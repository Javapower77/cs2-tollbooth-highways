# Tollbooth Highways for Cities Skylines II
This project is part of my journey of learning to make mods in this amazing game that I had loved for years.
Is based on Unity ECS and DOTS.
The construction of this mod is, of course, thanks to the amazing collobartion of some many people on CS2 Mod Discord server who are very nice, patiente and with high of human quality.
To all of them, I am eternaly gratful to be patience with me and help in every question I had mad.
This mod of course will evolute meanwhile I keep learning new stuf in this type of developming.

# Objetive
Make two special roads, one for Pulbic Transport only and the other for the rest of type of vehicle. This give the flexibility in the game to create the style of Toll system as the user can imagine.
Also made some StampPrefab ojetcs to create a composition of toll roads as an assets.
By using the Mod Setting it has a lot of configuration to set the price according the type of vehicle, the time of the day and the weekends.
Clicking on the toll booth the game will show the type of vehicles, the quantity and the aumont of many generated so far.
A main Panel will represent all toll booth generating the money the will inject to the main game.
Ability to associate the toll road to a specific districts

Well, that is the goal of this mod and that is what I am going to try to achieve. Is most likely that CO realease some Toll DLC sooner, but that will not stop me to continue on this mod, because as I had metinoned, it is all about learning. 🇦🇷 💻 🤟
